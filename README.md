# Unity-Ontology-SDL
This repository is an application created as part of the VIPR-GS FA 1.1 Task 6. The application helps create scenarios using a pre-defined scenario description language. The scenarios are created in the Unity engine. Various sensors can be incorporated into the scenarios, which is achieved by cloning the existing [Unity ROS sensor](https://github.com/Field-Robotics-Japan/UnitySensors) repository. 

Clone this repository
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/shailendranpoyyamozhi/Unity-Ontology-SDL.git
```
`IMPORTANT` Many files are missed while pushing the unity files to github. If the file doesnt open in unity, I would recommend to download the unity file from this [google drive file](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19rzfCP89u-Lyg5wCfJ2ipFJI-J1qKtI3?usp=drive_link)
