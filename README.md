# Unity-Ontology-SDL
This repository is an application created as part of the VIPR-GS FA 1.1 Task 6. The application helps create scenarios using a pre-defined scenario description language. The scenarios are created in the Unity engine. Various sensors can be incorporated into the scenarios, which is achieved by cloning the existing [Unity ROS sensor](https://github.com/Field-Robotics-Japan/UnitySensors) repository.
